    <p>Whenever an illness or injury occurs, you need to decide how serious it is and how soon to get medical care. This
        will help you choose whether it is best to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Call your health care provider</li>
        <li>Go to an urgent care clinic</li>
        <li>Go to an emergency department right away</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It pays to think about the right place to go. Treatment in an emergency department can cost 2 to 3 times more
        than the same care in your provider's office. Think about this and the other issues listed below when deciding.
    </p>
    <h2>Signs of an Emergency</h2>
    <p>How quickly do you need care? If a person or unborn baby could die or be permanently disabled, it is an
        emergency.</p>
    <p>Call 911 or the local emergency number to have the emergency team come to you right away if you cannot wait, such
        as for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choking</li>
        <li>Stopped breathing</li>
        <li>Head injury with passing out, fainting, or confusion</li>
        <li>Injury to neck or spine, particularly if there is loss of feeling or inability to move</li>
        <li>Electric shock or lightning strike</li>
        <li>Severe burn</li>
        <li>Severe chest pain or pressure</li>
        <li>Seizure that lasted 3 to 5 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Go to an emergency department or call 911 or the local emergency number for help for problems such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trouble breathing</li>
        <li>Passing out, fainting</li>
        <li>Pain in the arm or jaw</li>
        <li>Unusual or bad headache, particularly if it started suddenly</li>
        <li>Suddenly not able to speak, see, walk, or move</li>
        <li>Suddenly weak or drooping on one side of the body</li>
        <li>Dizziness or weakness that does not go away</li>
        <li>Inhaled smoke or poisonous fumes</li>
        <li>Sudden confusion</li>
        <li>Heavy bleeding</li>
        <li>Possible broken bone, loss of movement, particularly if the bone is pushing through the skin</li>
        <li>Deep wound</li>
        <li>Serious burn</li>
        <li>Coughing or throwing up blood</li>
        <li>Severe pain anywhere on the body</li>
        <li>Severe allergic reaction with trouble breathing, swelling, hives</li>
        <li>High fever with headache and stiff neck</li>
        <li>High fever that does not get better with medicine</li>
        <li>Throwing up or loose stools that does not stop</li>
        <li>Poisoning or overdose of drug or alcohol</li>
        <li>Suicidal thoughts</li>
        <li>Seizures</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>When to go to an Urgent Care Clinic</h2>
    <p>When you have a problem, do not wait too long to get medical care. If your problem is not life threatening or
        risking disability, but you are concerned and you cannot see your provider soon enough, go to an urgent care
        clinic.</p>
    <p>The kinds of problems an urgent care clinic can deal with include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Common illnesses, such as colds, the flu, earaches, sore throats, migraines, low-grade fevers, and limited
            rashes</li>
        <li>Minor injuries, such as sprains, back pain, minor cuts and burns, minor broken bones, or minor eye injuries
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>If you are not Sure, Talk to Someone</h2>
    <p>If you are not sure what to do, and you don't have one of the serious conditions listed above, call your
        provider. If the office is not open, your phone call may be forwarded to someone. Describe your symptoms to the
        provider who answers your call, and find out what you should do.</p>
    <p>Your provider or health insurance company may also offer a nurse telephone advice hotline. Call this number and
        tell the nurse your symptoms for advice on what to do.</p>

    <p>Before you have a medical problem, learn what your choices are. Check the website of your health insurance
        company. Put these telephone numbers in the memory of your phone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your provider</li>
        <li>The closest emergency department</li>
        <li>Nurse telephone advice line</li>
        <li>Urgent care clinic</li>
        <li>Walk-in clinic</li>
    </ul>
