                            <h3>Chiropractic Care</h3>
                            <p>We provide advanced spinal correction and chiropractic adjustments utilizing "state of
                                the art" chiropractic techniques. Never in the history of chiropractic care have
                                chiropractors been able to provide the level of help and expertise that is available
                                today. Many of the newest chiropractic techniques are actually safer, more comfortable
                                and more effective than ever before. As a chiropractor who cares about utilizing the
                                most advanced chiropractic techniques, Dr. Jason Harkey has years of training, expertise
                                and experience in helping patients get pain relief for back pain, neck pain, headaches,
                                and other related conditions originating from the spine. Chiropractic care under a
                                trained professional can even be used to prevent injuries and help you achieve total
                                health or wellness.</p>

                            <h3>Corrective Exercises</h3>
                            <p>At Harkey Chiropractic, we teach our patients how to perform special "blueprint"
                                exercises which can help strengthen and correct the irregularities in their body which
                                may be causing pain. Many of these corrective exercises can actually be performed in the
                                comfort of your own home to help improve the effectiveness of your chiropractic care and
                                spinal correction plan.&nbsp;In addition to skeletal misalignment, you may be
                                experiencing pain that is caused by muscles and connective tissues which are out of
                                their proper place. Other types of pain such as back pain, neck pain, and headaches are
                                caused by muscles and tissues that are being used improperly, causing injuries over
                                time. In each case, targeted corrective exercises and stretches from our experienced
                                chiropractor will help you feel good while also helping your body achieve balance and
                                health.</p>

                            <h3>Lifestyle Advice</h3>
                            <p>Many of our patients come to see our chiropractor to address a specific pain symptom such
                                as back pain, neck pain or headaches. While our chiropractor will address each patient's
                                specific condition with chiropractic care, we often find it helpful to "coach" our
                                patients towards achieving a healthier lifestyle. For example, there may be certain
                                activities that you should avoid or do differently to prevent yourself from
                                unintentionally aggravating your particular health challenges. The goal of including
                                lifestyle advice with a chiropractic care plan is to help each and every patient achieve
                                the fulfilling and happy lifestyle they deserve, one that is full of the activities that
                                are enjoyed most. We recognize that every single one of our patients is a whole person,
                                and we use our expertise to help them reach total health and wellness.</p>

                            <h3>Nutritional Counseling</h3>
                            <p>What does nutrition have to do with chiropractic care? The goal of chiropractic care is
                                to help patients achieve total health and balance with their body, and as part of that
                                goal we provide specific recommendations on nutritional supplements and healthy food
                                choices. Nutritional counseling by our experienced chiropractic health professionals can
                                assist a patient on their return to optimal health. Do you know which supplements and
                                vitamins are good for you? Do you know how these supplements and vitamins interact with
                                one another? At our Sumter chiropractic clinic, we can provide each patient with a
                                structured nutritional program that is based on their individual needs.</p>

                            <h3>Spinal &amp; Postural Screenings</h3>
                            <p>There is a saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Your spinal
                                health is no exception. Posture and spinal screenings by a trained and experienced
                                chiropractor such as Dr. Jason Harkey can help reveal important health information,
                                unlocking the door to improved health and well-being. In order to help the Sumter
                                community, we provide screenings at area malls, community events, health fairs and
                                places of employment. Contact us today at (555) 555-5555 to arrange a screening at your
                                event or workplace.</p>
