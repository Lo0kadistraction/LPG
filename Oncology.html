        <p>Oncology is the study of cancer. An oncologist is a doctor who treats cancer and provides medical care for a
            person diagnosed with cancer.</p>
        <p>The field of oncology has three major areas: medical, surgical, and radiation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>medical oncologist</b> treats cancer using chemotherapy or other medications, such as targeted
                    therapy or immunotherapy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>surgical oncologist</b> removes the tumor and nearby tissue during surgery. He or she also
                    performs certain types of biopsies to help diagnose cancer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>radiation oncologist</b> treats cancer using radiation therapy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other types of oncologists include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>gynecologic oncologist</b> treats gynecologic cancers, such as uterine, ovarian, and cervical
                    cancers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>pediatric oncologist</b> treats cancer in children. Some types of cancer occur most often in
                    children and teenagers. This includes certain brain tumors, leukemia, osteosarcoma, and Ewing’s
                    sarcoma. Types of cancer more common in children sometimes also occur in adults. In these
                    situations, an adult may decide to work with a pediatric oncologist.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>hematologist-oncologist</b> diagnoses and treats blood cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and
                    myeloma.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The role of the oncologist</h3>
        <p>An oncologist manages a patient’s care throughout the course of the disease. This starts with the diagnosis.
            His or her role includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Explaining the cancer diagnosis and stage</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Talking about all treatment options and his or her preferred choice</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Delivering quality and compassionate care</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Helping a patient manage the symptoms and side effects of cancer and cancer treatment.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Different types of doctors often work together to create a patient’s overall treatment plan that combines
            different types of treatments. For instance, a patient may need treatment with a combination of surgery,
            chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. This is called a multidisciplinary team.</p>
        <p>Cancer care teams also include a variety of other health care professionals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>pathologist</b> reads laboratory tests. This includes checking cells, tissues, and organs to
                    diagnose disease</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A <b>diagnostic radiologist</b> conducts imaging tests to diagnose disease. This includes x-rays or
                    ultrasound tests.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>An <b>oncology nurse</b></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>An <b>oncology social worker</b></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The team may also involve doctors from other areas of medicine. For instance, a dermatologist who specializes
            in skin problems may also help treat skin cancer.</p>
        <p>Sometimes a person’s cancer diagnosis is complex. In this case, the patient’s oncologist may ask a tumor
            board to review the case. This involves medical experts from all areas of cancer care who come together to
            decide on the best treatment plan.</p>
